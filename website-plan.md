Kingdom Restoration Conference
Nothing is more frequently prophesied in Scripture than the restoration of the Kingdom-not even the coming of the Messiah. The very Name and reputation of the Most High is on the line!  He cannot, He will not, fail.
Our purpose is not to force the Restoration, but to prepare! Our vision is to gather and equip patriarchs and their families as building blocks that become small clans. Those clans will grow into tribes and networked fellowships across the world.
Join us for the Second Annual Kingdom Restoration Conferences as we meet, prepare, grow, and build.
